billtime
========

Billtime is an Arduino app to help you congratulate Bill on his many years at Datacom.

If you have a Bill in your life who needs congratulating (perhaps because he is leaving 
work after nearly 10 awesome years), you need Billtime.

Simply connect a Grove LCD to your IDC bus, and a button to digital pin 5. The button allows you to set the time, with a short press incrementing the minutes and a long press incrementing the hours.

BillTime works well in goodbye cards. However, you are not recommended to use BillTime as a clock as it is not very accurate!

Hot new features include changing colour and periodically saying "CONGRATS BILL!"
